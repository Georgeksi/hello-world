# hello-world
This is my first repository

Just messing around with GitHub. My first branch. Today's Date: 05/4/2018 Time: 9:32PM . Got off work at 5PM, got home at 6:20PM. 

Anyways, I'm making these changes because the guide told me to. So this is a branch and i'm going to commit the changes to 'Master'
